* **STEP 1:** Run the Python code "main.py" to download the data from Copernicus CAMS. The output data will be a list of NUTS3 regions with a column for the Number of Dangerous Days due to high concentrations of PM2.5
* **STEP 2:** Navigate to folder "R/00_General/" and run code ImportDatasets.R. Make sure the paths at the top of the code point to the path of the data downloaded from Python in **STEP 1** above. More specifically, verify or ammend appropriately the following paths:
  * general_path
  * reanal_yearly_path
  * reanal_mnthly_path
  * forcst_mnthly_path
